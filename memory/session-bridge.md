# Session Bridge

> Durable checkpoint mirror. Read first at startup; `.corgi/loop` remains lifecycle authority. `corgispec archive --local` alone writes archive closeout fields.

## Delivery Pointer
- **RFC**: RFC-0002-architecture-portfolio
- **RFC Revision**: 7b6f7a58f4dcbb8fb4bbdf3a8ba74ba66f222cce
- **Slice**: S-01-application-runtime-foundation
- **Issue**: 6 https://github.com/m2048ws/trading/issues/6
- **Change**: introduce-application-and-runtime-foundation
- **Worktree**: /Users/m/src/money/.worktrees/introduce-application-and-runtime-foundation
- **Phase at Checkpoint**: applying
- **Task Group at Checkpoint**: 1
- **Observed Run Revision**: 2
- **Last Verified HEAD**: 6fe255164044ce04da9d4e3b49e44ff4d266e57e

## Next Action
- Commit and acknowledge Task Group 1 after its clean baseline and structured review.

## Blockers
- none

## Uncommitted Work
- Session Bridge checkpoint for Task Group 1.

## Discoveries
- Baseline inventory confirms `LiveCatalog[F]`, `CatalogModel`, completed-JAR compiler fixtures, and the non-published
  benchmark project already exist; no `runtime` module or concrete live-catalog interpreter exists yet.

## Promotion Queue
- After whole-change verification and Archive, promote the delivered runtime/application dependency boundary and
  in-memory interpreter ownership from concrete source evidence.
